# SeAI - Quick Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run SeAI in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- Python 3.8+ ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Node.js 14+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Backend Setup

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate secure master key
python key_manager.py
```

When prompted:
1. Choose option `1` (Generate a new random master key)
2. Type `y` to save the key to `.env` file

### 2. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal** window and run:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
SeAI Backend Server Starting...
Encryption: AES-256-GCM
Steganography: LSB Technique
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Application

1. **Go to "Embed SeAl Tag" tab**
   - Upload any image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or BMP)
   - Click "Embed SeAl Tag"
   - Download the sealed image

2. **Go to "Verify SeAl Tag" tab**
   - Upload the sealed image you just downloaded
   - Click "Verify SeAl Tag"
   - You should see "SeAl tag verified!" ✓

3. **Test with an unsealed image**
   - Upload any regular image (not sealed)
   - Click "Verify SeAl Tag"
   - You should see "This image was not generated by AI" ✗

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory and virtual environment is activated
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Cannot find module" errors (Frontend)
```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
npm install
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Backend (Port 5000):
# Kill any process using port 5000, or change the port in app.py

# Frontend (Port 3000):
# The browser will prompt you to use a different port
```

### Backend not connecting
- Make sure Flask is running on port 5000
- Check that you see "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000" in the backend terminal

## Next Steps

- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Check the [Information] tab in the app for usage guidelines
- Customize the master key in `.env` for production use

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Start Backend
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
python app.py

# Start Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm start

# Generate New Key
cd backend
python key_manager.py
```

## Security Reminder

⚠️ **Important**: The `.env` file contains your master encryption key.
- Never commit it to version control
- Keep it secure
- Use a different key for production
